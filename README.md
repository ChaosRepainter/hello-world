Hi Humans!

I love Python and Rust!
I really like Python because it is very easy to read and intuitive.
However, Python is slow.
I made a simple game using Tkinter, and it took about 3 seconds to launch the game. (This is the time for a non-single file)

So, I decide to learn Rust for ultimate speed.
